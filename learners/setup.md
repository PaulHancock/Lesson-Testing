## Assumed knowledge and software requirements

This course assumes that you have basic proficiency in python. While python is the language that we’ll be working with primarily, most of the lessons are applicable to any language.

A large part of working in a group will involve keeping track of changes to a shared code base. For this we will be using the git version control system, and in particular we will be using GitHub as the remote repository.

### Software requirements

- Python 3.6 +
- A integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor of choice
  - We recommend PyCharm or Visual Studio Code
- An operating system which gives you a proper command line
  - For windows this means using something like gitbash, WSL, or the Anaconda prompt
  - For OSX or Linux the regular terminal will be fine
- git, either from the command line, using a git desktop app, or as an add on to PyCharm or VSCode.
- 
An account on [GitHub][github] is required for some of the activities.
