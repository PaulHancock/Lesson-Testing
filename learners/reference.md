## Glossary

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
: The broad field focused on building systems that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence, such as reasoning or perception.

Machine Learning (ML)
: A subset of AI where models learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

Model
: A mathematical representation learned from data that maps inputs to outputs.

Training Data
: The dataset used to teach a model by adjusting its parameters.

Inference
: The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data.

Feature
: An individual measurable property or input variable used by a model.

Label
: The correct output or target value associated with a data point in supervised learning.

Supervised Learning
: ML where models are trained on labeled data.

Unsupervised Learning
: ML where models discover patterns in unlabeled data.

Overfitting
: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data due to excessive complexity.
